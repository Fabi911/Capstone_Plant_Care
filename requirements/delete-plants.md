## Delete Plant Entries

## Value Proposition

**As a** plant owner,

**I want to** delete plant entries from my plant collection,

**so that** I can keep my digital garden updated with only the plants I currently own.

## Description

_Wireframe tbc._

- The "Delete" option is intuitive to find, perhaps represented by a trash can icon or a clearly labeled button.
- Clicking the "Delete" button triggers a confirmation dialog.
- The dialog serves to prevent accidental deletions by asking the user to confirm their intention.
- The dialog includes options for both confirming the deletion and cancelling the action.
